Here is our new development board design. It will include ESP32 S3 with PSRAM, LoRa module, several powering options as well as a wide prototyping area. As a successor of my recent H2S-Dev board the new hardware will be compatible with Helium and Meshtastic networks, ready to develop a simple node, sensor or even more!
